  2009/04/03 - ASE 15 related fixes/upgrades.  Fixed bad table partition
               counts for ASE 15.  Added support for "unsigned" int data
               types in ASE 15.  Probably lots of other new ASE 15 is not
               supported.  Ben Slade.
Release 2.4.2
  03/02/08 - David Owen (dowen@midsomer.org)  Thanks to Alexey Egorov,
             Rene van Leeuwen, Ilya Zvyagin, Dmitry Chuev, Alan Sheu and
             Jim Lewis for bug reports, fixes and suggestions.

      o Added the following new options:
          --bcp-arg            Arguments specified here are used for both
                               bcp 'in' and 'out'.
          --bcp-in-arg         These args are passed to just bcp 'in'.
          --bcp-out-arg        These args are passed to just bcp 'out' (duh!).

        Normally, I would not add new functionality to a 'point' release, but I
        think that this is more by way of adding to a feature that was there.  
        These options allow for the specification of bcp arguments for field 
	and row separators etc.  Should have been there all along I guess.
      o Print out devices in the correct order of creation.

      Bug Fixes.

      00023 - Not putting out the "END" when -k but *not* -V selected for
              certain objects (those stored in syscomments).
      00024 - Getting the system directory wrong when extracting the server
              information in -O2 mode.
      00025 - 'whoami' not working on Solaris.
      00026 - Not extract segment information correctly for indexes built on
              segments with segment number > 3.
      00027 - Corrected a small fault in the way that groups are extracted.
      00028 - '--noreferences' caused script to fail extracting just indexes.
      00029 - The defaults hash was not being cleared out between databases, so
              it just kept building.

Release 2.4.1
  03/01/19 - David Owen (dowen@midsomer.org)  Thanks to Doug Roderick and
             Karl Glimm for bug reports.

      o Changed the name of the directory for the system stuff when using
        -a or -A from 'system' to 'system-DDL'.
      o Added the ability to specify a couple of variables in the -o option so
        that you can more flexibly choose the output filenames.

      Bug Fixes.

      00021 - Don't create the 'system DDL' directory unless specifying '-m'.
      00022 - Remove the trailing 'ESD...' from the version string if it exists.

Release 2.4.0
  02/12/29 - David Owen (dowen@midsomer.org)  Thanks to Tobias Sager, Daniel Cron,
             Malcolm Wotton, Dmitry Chuev, Mark Anderson and Ateeq Ahmad for the
             bug reports and fixes.

      o Added the following new options:
          --quiet              Should be obvious!  Overrides all -v's.
          --for-sql-server     Helps in the migration to M$ SQL Server.
          --[no]references     Toggles printing of foreign key references.
          --target-db          Specify database for 'use <database>' statement.
          --exclude-db or -X   Excludes databases from the list to be extracted.
      o Improved the layout of the extracted code to try and ensure no
        'extra' lines are added to objects.  (Some extraction tools add
        additional, unwanted, blanks lines to the extracted code making
        comparison difficult.)
      o Changed the way tables are extracted in 'for-compare' mode to make
        comparison more consistent.
      o New mailing list.  Send email to dbschema-l-subscribe@midsomer.org.


      Bug Fixes.

      00012 - Replace non-ANSI strings with correct ANSI versions.
      00013 - Not writing -J and -z options to bcp commands.
      00014 - Not writing out the existance checks for some objects when -k
              selected.
      00015 - Falsely matching t_sysname as sysname.
      00016 - Typos in usage.
      00017 - Fails to handle case when the extraction user does not belong to a
              database he is trying to extract.
      00018 - Regular users performing extracts generated errors when extracting
              groups.
      00019 - Incorrectly adding 'sp_logdevice' when generating --for-load.
      00020 - Not adding 'sp_logdevice' for first all log device if it was not the
              2nd device.

Release 2.3.1
  02/04/10 - David Owen (dowen@midsomer.org) Thanks to Erik Bertelsen for
             the bug report and the fix.

      Bug Fixes.

      00011 - Not separating views into their correct tables if -O2
              selected.

Release 2.3.0
  02/04/08 - David Owen (dowen@midsomer.org) (Wow, doesn't a year fly!)
             with thanks to Daniel Cron, Jonathan Allen, Andrey V. Kolchanov,
             Chito Domingo, Dimitry Ioffe, Steve Baumgarten, David Eyer,
             Mark Atkins
      o Added following new options:
          --[no]use-database   Make the 'use <db>' headers optional.
          --[no]comments       Make comments in output optional
          --[no]setuser        Make 'setuser' statements optional
          --[no]permissions    Make permissions parts optional.
          --packet-size        Set the client packet size.
          --force-defaults     Used to force the extraction of default
                               items that are optional, ie 'ASC' in index
                               creation or "dsync='on'" in the disk init.
          -J <charset>         Specify server charset.
          -z <locale>          Specify locale for client.
          -c <cmdend>          Use <cmdend> in place of 'go'
      o Made verbosity have levels.  Currently have only a couple of levels.
      o Added option to replace 'go' string.
      o Changed the way that views are extracted so that they can either be
        extracted in dependent order (as per tables etc) or sorted (so that
        you can do compares between systems.)
      o The drops for users, logins, types, defaults are not included
        (pretty much anything created using a stored proc).  I have decided
        that this is not really a fault.  I looked at doing it, but it
        turns out to be a right royal pain.  If a user owns a table, you
        cannot drop him or her.  Defaults must be unbound before being
        dropped, etc etc etc.  If anyone can think of a good way of
        achieving this, if, indeed, it would be useful, I would be happy to
        have a go.  The best I have come up with is putting them all in a
        separate file to be dropped after the rest of the items.
      o Database creation statements are now stored in their respective
        subdirectory when using '-a' or '-A'.

  02/04/07 - Mark Mertel (mmertel@olympus.net) Added procedure grouping stuff.

      Bug Fixes.

      00004 - Incorrectly overwriting the database build script when using
              the '-a' and '-A' flags.
      00005 - As a result of the code to extract indexes still being in two
              places, the extraction of indexes on DOL tables was not
              getting the CLUSTERED attribute correct.
      00006 - Not extracting all columns for indexes containing more than
              16 columns (throw back to days when this was not permitted
              within ASE.)
      00007 - Overwriting the database create statements when -a or -A is
              selected.
      00008 - Not sorting the table order properly when -O1 is selected.
      00009 - Not counting the permissions extracted correctly.
      00010 - Error opening file handle if extracting a single object with
              -O2.

Release 2.2.4

  02/04/16 - David Owen (dowen@midsomer.org)
      o Added '-F' flag.
      o Added 'ASC/DESC' for ASE 12 indexes.
      o Reorg'd the index extraction code so that there aren't two lots of
        the same code doing the same job.
      o Added a check to ensure that the database being extracted actually
        exists.

      Bug Fixes.

      00001 - Incorrectly extracting DOL tables when the '-f' flag was
              selected.

Release 2.2.3

  01/11/24 - David Owen (dowen@midsomer.org)
      o Switched to using long option names.  All old option names will
        continue to work (let me know if they don't!) as they did, but
        some now have more meaningful names.  Well a couple so far.
      o Added following switches:
          --for-compare   Makes extraction of views and procs alphabetic
                          rather than pseudo dependent.
          --for-load      Adds 'for load' statements to the build db.
          --dsync={on|off|true|false}
                          Adds dsync lines to the disk init commands.
          --asa           Does nothing, yet!
          --stdin         Allows the user to pipe the password in rather
                          than have it on the command line.
          --[no]cis       Toggles whether CIS tables are extracted using
                          'EXISTING' clause.
      o Obviously, CIS tables are now extracted correctly!
      o Added some pod documentation, mainly for CPAN's benefit.
      o Added support for the (defunct) datatypes 'intn' etc.
      o Added a call to 'sp_logdevice' for databases that were built
        in the normal data + log manner.  Could be erroneous, but
        unlikely.
      o -D can be used multiple times to supply a list of databases.

  01/10/01 - Malcolm Wotton (wotton@globalnet.co.uk)
      Fixed a bug with the selection of circular references in tables.  If
      tableA and tableAB where linked with FK constraint, possible to fail
      to drop tableA because it is seen as part of string 'tableAB'.

      Bug Fixes.

      00002 - sybsyntax and sybsystemdb being extracted with '-a' flag.
      00003 - Tables whose name is an exact substring of another were
              wrongly being omitted from the extraction process.

Release 2.2.2

      o All of the 2.2.2 changes were lost in some calamity.  I was just
        looking at the code and it was not there!  Too late now!  The
        changes that were here have been rolled up into 2.2.4.

Release 2.2.1

  01/04/01 - John Hennessy (john.hennessy@dcs.qld.gov.au)
      Fixed the error with DOL tables not correctly specifying the clustered
      index.

Release 2.2.0

  01/03/01 - David Owen
      Thanks go to Coston Cheatham (ccheatha@jwac.osis.gov) for a lot of
      the changes and fixes that went into this release
      A number of cleanups, reordering of index creation, allowing
      separation of index and trigger creation and forced separation of the
      database creation statements.  Allowing for the separation of the
      triggers and the indexes allowes for the generation of better scripts
      for migration purposes, where both could get in the way of loading
      data.
      Add some stats so that people can see just what is being extracted,
      plus it helps me tremendously with testing.
      Fixed an error in the extraction of tables that contained recursive
      constraints.
      Tried to ensure that independent objects are extracted before dependent
      ones, although I do not seem to have hit 100%.
      Made the table definition extraction look a lot prettier (lined up
      columns etc).
  01/01/30 - Geoffrey Rommel (GRommel@Webley.COM)
      Added the '-T' flag.
  01/01/09 - David Owen
      Removed the dependency on ctime.pl.

Release 2.1.4

  01/01/05 - David Owen (on behalf of Andreas Mahling)
      Modified to extract the tables, indexes and foreign keys separately
      to improve the speed of rebuilding a foreign database.  Also added
      a "-b" flag to build the necessary bcp scripts to extract the data
      and subsequently re-import it.
  01/01/04 - David Owen
      Applied some bug fixes sent in by Yevgeniy Tishkin.
  00/10/20 - (tboss) Todd Boss
      Modified to correctly handle non-dbo owned objects
  00/08/27 - Christopher Singer
      Improved the generation of the grants/revokes to only issue a
      single grant/revoke per ID.
  00/05/08 - Al McNamee, John Erjavec V
      Added fix to insert datarow locking into DDL of datarow locked
      tables.
  00/04/23 - David Owen
      Applied fix as supplied by Andrew D. Farmer to better extract the
      table permissions (especially column level permissions).
  00/03/24 - David Owen
      Finished off the generation of the "drop" statements.  (Cannot
      work out a very neat way to do the logins and users etc.  I feel
      a separate file is the only "nice" way.  Little point in simply
      adding the drop just before the create, a la tables, since it is
      of little use.  Will continue to think on it.)
      Prepended "exec " to all "sp" calls, so that they can be used in
      multiple batches without fear that there may have been lots of
      them.
      Do not port the 'probe' login.
      Fixed bug that was setting the mode incorrectly for the
      subdirectories.
      Fixed the order that objects were created.  Groups and users need
      to be created before objects so that permissions can be assigned
      correctly.
      Removed the "ON 'default'" that was being generated.  I don't
      believe that it is necessary, if someone knows something that I
      don't, let me know.
      Added segment extractions for each database.
      Added "ON 'segment'" for tables.
      Tried to make it fit within 80 cols for those with narrow screens
      (Anthony!!).
      Thanks to Rolf Jordi for supplying fixes to a number of bugs and
      some excellent suggestions for improvement.  Look out for version
      3.0!
      Thanks to Eric Maes and Robert Banniza for feedback and help in
      ironing out some bugs.
  99/12/09 - David Owen
      Made command switches consistent with standard Sybase set.
      Added options to allow the output to be split into multiple
      files.  (-O)
      Changed the password prompting to handle w 9x.
      Only produce the log file if there is an error or the "-v" option
      is chosen.
      Moved all of the work for each type into its own sub.
      Added code to extract the database build DDL.
      Some of the DDL code was taken from
      dpartridge's changes that became dbschema.disk.pl.  That file
      should be no longer be necessary as all of its functionality (and
      more) can be found here.
  99/12/08 - Robert Banniza
      Changes made to reflect whether CLUSTERED or NONCLUSTERED
      indexes. Also reflects information for default segments and other
      segments besides logsegments.
  99/11/08 - Alain Trembleau
      Fixed foreign key bug in printKeys().
  97/03/12 - Michael Peppler
      Added -i switch to set an alternate interfaces file.
  97/03/11 - David Whitmarsh
      Bug handling user defined types used as identity columns.
      addtype now has scale, prec
      Removed spurious addtypes for nchar etc. null/not null/identity
      on types
  97/02/17 - Michael Peppler
      Fixed small ',' problem in printKeys()
  96/11/11 - David Whitmarsh
      Use Sybase::DBlib System 10 declarative RI constraints
      Eliminate key truncation problems
      Optional password command line
      Debugged and strictified
      Some index/key options
  95/10/13 - Ashu Joglekar
      System 10 w/o RI
  94/09/15 - mpeppler
      Minor changes for use with Sybperl2 alpha1
  94/02/22 - mpeppler
      Merge bpapp's changes with itf version'
  93/11/18 - bpapp
      Get protection information for views and stored procedures.
  93/11/18 - bpapp
      Put in interactive SA password prompt
