dbschema.pl is a Sybperl script that will extract a database structure from
a Sybase ASE database.  Whilst that, in a nutshell, is all that this script
actually does, it can do that one function in probably as flexible a manner
as you could wish.  Basically works with Sybase version 15 (ASE 15), but
probably doesn't support lots of the new features in ASE 15.

It can extract a single database into a single file, a single file per
object type (tables, procs, indexes etc) or a single file per actual
object.  The number of options is getting so large that I am writing a Tk
GUI to make it easier to manage, as well as the ability to extract single
objects in a point and shoot fashion!

                  The actual extraction perl script.  Uses Sybase::DBlib,
                  which can be obtained from Micheal Peppler's site
                  (http://www.mbay.net/~mpeppler).

              migrate_to_sqlserver.pl -
                  Helps migrate triggers and stored procs to a more SQL
                  Server loadable format.  Anything that is simply not
                  supported is commented out with a "FIXME" token added to
                  the end of the line.

              xearth.map -
                  No longer used.  Used to be a list of people who use 
                  the software and wish to be open about it!

              CHANGES -
                See the CHANGES file.
                2009/04/03 - ASE 15 related fixes/upgrades. Fixed bad table partition
                counts for ASE 15. Added support for "unsigned" int data
                types in ASE 15. Probably lots of other new ASE 15 features
                are not supported. Ben Slade.
