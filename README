dbschema.pl is a Sybperl script that will extract a database structure from
a Sybase ASE database.  Whilst that, in a nutshell, is all that this script
actually does, it can do that one function in probably as flexible a manner
as you could wish.

It can extract a single database into a single file, a single file per
object type (tables, procs, indexes etc) or a single file per actual
object.  The number of options is getting so large that I am writing a Tk
GUI to make it easier to manage, as well as the ability to extract single
objects in a point and shoot fashion!

                  The actual extraction perl script.  Uses Sybase::DBlib,
                  which can be obtained from Micheal Peppler's site
                  (http://www.mbay.net/~mpeppler).

              migrate_to_sqlserver.pl -
                  Helps migrate triggers and stored procs to a more SQL
                  Server loadable format.  Anything that is simply not
                  supported is commented out with a "FIXME" token added to
                  the end of the line.
